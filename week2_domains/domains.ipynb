The real magic is, since the variables are related to their time derivatives as time moves on, this relation can be solved to find what $y(t)$ is as a __function of time__, hence the $(t)$. But we need to know enough number of values of $y(t)$ and its derivatives at some point in time (two in this case, say $y(0)$ and $\\dot y(0)$, since it's a second order DE. Remember MATH219!) and all values of $x(t)$ in all points of time. We refer to the particular values of $y(t)$ that we know as \"boundary conditions\" or \"initial conditions\" (whichever makes more sense for the given problem) and $x(t)$ as input. Finally, the coefficients of our differential equation are also known, they usually represent physical quantities such as mass or electrical resistance. These coefficients often don't change with respect to time, but not always so we call a system __time invariant__ when they don't (since our coefficients are not functions of time, our arbitrary differential equation could only model a __linear time invariant__ system).
